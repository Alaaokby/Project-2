## MyReads Project
A React application for managing books to read/already read. Similar to Goodreads.

The bookshelf app allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. Users can search for books and add books to their bookshelf. Data is persisted by the udacity backend server.

Originally just provided with a static css, html template (no react code). The project was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring it into a usuable react front end application. There is an API server and client library that is used to persist information as you interact with the application.


## How to Use the App
Books are sorted into three categories: 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Read' To change a book's category or remove a book from the list, click on the green button on the book cover . To add new books, click on the green + button at the bottom of the page. Enter an author's name or subject in the search bar to find more books.
